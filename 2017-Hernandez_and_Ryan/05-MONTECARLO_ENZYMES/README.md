script generates 1000 random datasets--from 7 bacteria protein sets--that match the number of bacterial HGTs from each of the animal species looked at (e.g. Mnemiopsis leidyi) and counts the number of bacterial HGTs that are enzymes in the test set(s) and compares that to the number in our actual data (e.g. Mnemiopsis leidyi).
